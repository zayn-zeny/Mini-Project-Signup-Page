Sign-Up Page Project
This repository contains a simple, responsive sign-up page built using HTML and CSS as part of my journey into web development. The project features a clean, modern design with a gradient background, a blurred glass effect for the form container, and decorative circular elements. Itâ€™s my first hands-on project to apply foundational HTML and CSS skills, and Iâ€™m excited to share it!

Interactive Form: Includes input fields for full name, email, and password with a hover effect on the submit button.
Decorative Elements: Two circular gradient shapes enhance the visual appeal.
Clean Code: Semantic HTML and well-structured CSS for readability and maintenance.

Technologies Used

HTML5: For structuring the sign-up page.
CSS3: For styling, including gradients, flexbox, and backdrop-filter for the glass effect.
